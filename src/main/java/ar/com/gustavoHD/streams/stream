definition

types:
* Froma technical point of view:
    - a typed interface:
        public interface Stream<T> extendsBaseStream<T, Stream<T>> {
            // interface
        }
    - Also: IntStream, LongStream& DoubleStream



properties
    * A Stream does not hold any data
        - It pulls the data it processes from a source
    * A Stream does not modify the data it processes
        - Because we want to process the data in parallel with no visibility issues
    * The source maybe unbounded
        - Which can mean it is not finite
        - But most of the time, it only means that the size of this source is not known at build time
